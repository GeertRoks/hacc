# Features

## CLI


With SG CLI you can easily get benefit of:

* User functions that help you to build your accelerated applications using SG HACC,
* Build and deploy EasyNet, or
* Build and deploy Coyote (among many other things).

## Vitis and Vivado workflows
Thanks to our [hot-plug boot](/vocabulary.md#hot-plug-boot) process, we are able to transition between the Vitis and Vivado workflows without the need of rebooting the system.

## Managed
We use [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](../docs/vocabulary.md#infrastructure-as-code-iac) and [Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)](../docs/vocabulary.md#ansible-automation-platform-aap) to [operate the cluster](../docs/operating-the-cluster.md) efficiently. Under the scope of a [DevOps](../docs/vocabulary.md#devops) methodology, we achieve the following: <!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code -->

* Continuos delivery,
* Avoid manual configuration to enforce consistency,
* Use declarative definition files helping to document the cluster,
* Easily follow Xilinxâ€™s tools versioning release schedule, and
* Deliver stable tests environments rapidly at scale.
