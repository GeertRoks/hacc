# Features

## Managed cluster
We use [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](./vocabulary.md#infrastructure-as-code-iac) and [Ansible Automation Platform (AAP)](./vocabulary.md#ansible-automation-platform-aap) to [operate the cluster](../docs/operating-the-cluster.md#operating-the-cluster) efficiently. Under the scope of a [DevOps](./vocabulary.md#devops) methodology, we achieve the following: 

* Continuos delivery,
* Avoid manual configuration to enforce consistency,
* Use declarative definition files helping to document the cluster,
* Easily follow AMDâ€™s tools versioning release schedule, and
* Deliver stable tests environments rapidly at scale.

## HACC Development (hdev)
By using [HACC Development (hdev)](https://github.com/fpgasystems/hdev), you can easily:

* Validate the fundamental infrastructure functionality of ETHZ-HACC, ensuring its reliability and performance.
* Expedite project creation through intuitive multiple-choice dialogs and templates, streamlining the development of your accelerated applications.
* Seamlessly integrate with [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) for efficient version control and collaboration.
* Effectively manage ASoCs, FPGAs, multi-core CPUs, and GPUs, all through a unified device index.
* Transition between [Vivado and Vitis workflows](./vocabulary.md#vivado-and-vitis-workflows) effortlessly, eliminating the need for system reboots and enhancing your development agility.
* Design, build, and deploy modern accelerated applications with ease, leveraging your own or third-party integrations.

<!-- This should be consistent with features on the hdev repository -->
