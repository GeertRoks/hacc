# Hardware acceleration platform
As a multi-core, GPU, and FPGA cluster, ETHZ-â€‹HACC allows research in distributed systems, databases, cloud computing, and hardware acceleration of data science. Internally, we are using ETHZ-HACC to conduct extensive research to assemble an [Infrastructure for heterogeneous architectures and hardware acceleration](https://systems.ethz.ch/research/data-processing-on-modern-hardware/hardware-acceleration-infrastructure.html). All our advances  are open-source and offered as a design platform through the [Systems Group RunTime.](https://github.com/fpgasystems/sgrt) With this initiative, we hope that ETHZ-HACC users will be able to develop their accelerated applications more quickly.
