# Hello, world!
This guideline will guide you through deploying, building, and running a [Hello, world!](../docs/vocabulary.md#hello-world) example running on SG HACC Alveo cards. In this case, the *Hello, world!* program reduces to a simple vector addition describing how to use HLS kernels in Vitis Environment [[1]](#references).

We will cover the following sections:
* [Accessing the cluster](#accessing-the-cluster)
* [Booking a server](#booking-a-server)
* [HLS vector addition](#hls-vector-addition)

Before continuing, please make sure you have been already accepted on ETH ZÃ¼rich HACC program and you have a valid user account. In any other case, please visit [Get started](https://www.amd-haccs.io/get-started.html).

## Accessing the cluster
Access to Linux systems from outside the ETH network is possible but subject to restrictions by the firewall. For accessing the HACC, two different methods are possible.

## Jump host

## VPN
