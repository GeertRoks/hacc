# Account renewal

The guest account expires after one year. A month before the deadline, you will receive an email reminder. If you plan to keep using the ETHZ-HACC, please write back to javier.moyapaya@inf.ethz.ch an email like the one in the picture below:

Once the account expires, all user data is automatically deleted from its home directory and the account cannot be restored.
