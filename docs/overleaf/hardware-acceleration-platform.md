# Hardware acceleration platform
As a multi-core, GPU, and FPGA cluster, ETHZ-â€‹HACC allows research in distributed systems, databases, cloud computing, and hardware acceleration of data science. Internally, we are using ETHZ-HACC to conduct extensive research to assemble an Infrastructure for heterogeneous architectures and hardware acceleration. All our advances  are open-source and offered as a design platform through the Systems Group RunTime. With this initiative, we hope that ETHZ-HACC users will be able to develop their accelerated applications more quickly.
