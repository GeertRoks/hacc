# Networking validation with EasyNet
In this experiment, we are using CLIâ€™s [sgutil validate easynet](../cli/docs/sgutil-validate-easynet.md) command to verify EasyNet on the ETHZ-HACC network.

### Prerrequisites
* You must have a valid authentication key pairs for SSH in your **~/.ssh** directory, and
* Your public key must be added to the authorized keys. 

```
$ ssh-keygen
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

If the public key **~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub** is not present, *sgutil validate iperf* will run the commands above for you automatically.
